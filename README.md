In 1583, J. Scaliger was working with historical events but those were described by several calendars.  
He wanted to correlate dates of events across the different calendars so he researched to find where in history the several calendars coincided.
The result was a series of mathematical algorithms to arrive at the date of events in each calendar.
Today, his algorithms are incorporated within most computer operating systems and all modern computer databases.
I coded his algorithms in IBM assembler language for mainframe OS/370, COBOL, Java, Fortran and C for use in applications.
